# Text_Generation
Generate text from a corpus

Inspired from a Siraj Ravel tutorial. Will be making more modifications
and try to improve solution.


At least 20 epochs are required before the generated text
starts sounding coherent.
It is recommended to run this script on GPU, as recurrent
networks are quite computationally intensive.
If you try this script on new data, make sure your corpus
has at least ~100k characters. ~1M is better.
